Principal component analysis was used as the primary data science tool in order to find songs similar to the user's tastes. We used a Spotify dataset with information on songs like "danceability, energy, mode, key, pitch, tempo, timbre, and so much more, Queue searches through thousands of songs and their audio features to make sure the next song is you." - [Queue](https://spotify-ss.herokuapp.com/).
