My project on gun violence data was insightful, and summarized on an interactive plotly map of the USA. I found that Chicago was the most dangerous city in the country when it comes to guns. Chicago alone has more gun victims than all other states. I wrote about my findings [here](https://medium.com/@joshdsolis/visualizing-gunshot-victims-in-the-us-9f11ddd4589b).
