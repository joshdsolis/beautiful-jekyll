Hi, I'm Josh Solis, a data scientist with a background in cognitive science.


### Data Science
I learned to use data science tools like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, keras, and sci-kit learn through Lambda School. I also have used application hosting services like Heroku, Netlify, and AWS Elastic Beanstalk. 


### Cognitive Science
I was always interested in the mind, so I studied Cognitive Science. Now I'm excited to apply what I've learned about the mind and brain to data science problems.
