Hi, I'm Josh Solis, A data scientist

- Cognitive Science undergrad


Studying Cognitive Science taught me to think outside of the box. I'd love to work with you to solve business problems using math and code.

### Cognitive Science
I was always interested in the mind, so I studied Cognitive Science. Now I'm excited to apply what I've learned about the mind and brain to data science problems.
